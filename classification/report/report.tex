\section*{Experimental Protocol}
%Suppose that someone wants to reproduce your results. Briefly describe the steps used to obtain the
%predictions starting from the raw data set downloaded from the project website. Use the following
%sections to explain your methodology. Feel free to add graphs or screenshots if you think it's
%necessary. The report should contain a maximum of 2 pages.

\section{Tools}
%Which tools and libraries have you used (e.g. Matlab, Python with scikit-learn, Java with Weka,
%SPSS, language x with library y, $\ldots$). If you have source-code (Matlab scripts, Python scripts, Java source folder, \dots),
%make sure to submit it on the project website together with this report. If you only used
%command-line or GUI-tools describe what you did.

We exclusively used $Matlab$ for this assignment.
We used $csvread$ to read the provided training and validation data sets and
$csvwrite$ to write our predictions. We also used $fitctree$ for desicision tree, $fitcdiscr$ for discriminant analysis, $fitcnb$ for multiclass naive Bayes, $fitcecoc$ for our support vector machine, $fitcknn$ for the KNN classifier and $TreeBagger$ for the random forest.


\section{Algorithm}
%Describe the algorithm you used for regression (e.g. ordinary least squares, ridge regression, $\ldots$)

Not yet define as we are still searching for the best one.


\section{Features}
%Did you construct any new features? What feature transforms did you use?

We used the kernel ... hyperparameters ... [Pius knows his stuff :) ]

\section{Parameters}
%How did you find the parameters of your model? (What parameters have you searched over, cross validation procedure, $\ldots$)

Try and errors...

\section{Lessons Learned}
%What other algorithms, tools or methods did you try out that didn't work well?
%Why do you think they performed worse than what you used for your final submission?

The majority voting is not working that great because we don't have enough diversity in the classifiers so trying to boost doesn't help.
